# UCP 000 - UC 001: Issue Command  
#The user selects a field object property to modify. Specifies the new value of the property and sees the change reflected in the UI. 
The User selects a field object from a hierarchy in the object browser, Then the System displays the properties to which the user has read access of the selected field object in the Work Area, after that the System verifies user has write access to property and enables “Issue Command” button for those properties for which the user has write access.The User selects the “Issue command” button, then the System prompts the user for the new value of the property, the User inputs a new value, the User confirms the command by selecting the “Send Command” button, the System transmits the command to the FSS, then the System indicates the command was sent but no confirmation was received yet, after that the FSS Sends a COV notification, confirming the success of the command, then the System displays the new property value in the Work Area. 

# UCP 000 - UC 002: Manage Change of Value  
#The Field System Simulator sends a notification of a Change of Value to the system. The system updates its internal object model, updates the UI and potentially executes Rules and Alarms.  
The FSS sends notification of Change of Value for an object property, then the System updates the property value in its internal object model, after that  The System updates the UI to reflect the new value of the property. 


# UCP 000 - UC 003: Trigger LnR Rule  
#A received Change of Value event changes the system status so that a Logic and Reaction condition is evaluated to the value = "true" and this causes the execution of a reaction (equivalent to the issuance of a command).  
The System receives a COV event and positively evaluates condition of at least one Logical condition, after the command that is configured in the reaction of the logical condition that evaluated to true will be executed, the order of execution of the rules is determined by their order in the "Configure Logic & Reaction". For each logical condition evaluated to a "true" value, the system executes all steps of the main success scenario. The order of execution of the rules is determined by their order in the "Configure Logic & Reaction" screen.

# UCP 000 - UC 004: Generate Alarm  
#A received Change of Value event changes the system status so that an Alarm condition is evaluated to the value = "true" and this causes the execution of an alarm rule and therefore the generation of an alarm.  
The System receives a COV event and positively evaluates condition of at least one Alarm rule, after the System persists the alarm and all its attributes in the system database and the System displays a new alarm line with the status “Not Ack.” at the top of the Alarm Viewer for all logged in users with read access to the associated alarm property. Then the System displays “Alarm Acknowledgment Request” dialog for all logged in users with read access to the associated alarm property. For each alarm rule evaluated to a "true" value, the system executes all steps of the main success scenario. The order of execution of the rules is determined by their order in the "Configure Alarm Rules" 

# UCP 000 - UC 005: Acknowledge Alarm  
#After an alarm is generated, a user acknowledges the alarm. The system updates the UI accordingly for all users.  
The User acknowledges the alarm by selecting the “Acknowledge Alarm” button in the Acknowledge Alarm Request dialog box, after The System updates the state of the alarm in the system database, the System closes the “Alarm Acknowledgment Request” dialog for all users seeing it, the System changes the status of the alarm to “Ack” in the Alarm Viewer for all users seeing it, the System assigns the user who acknowledged the alarm as the owner of the alarm and will update the database. 

# UCP 000 - UC 006: Dismiss Alarm  
#After an alarm is acknowledged by a user, this user or the administrator can dismiss it. The system updates the UI accordingly for all users.  
The User dismisses the alarm by selecting the action icon for the specific alarm in the AlarmDisplay, then the User selects the Dismiss Alarm Option from the popup window, after that the System verifies the alarm is acknowledged, the System verifies user is the owner of the acknowledged alarm, the System closes the “Alarm Dismissal Request” dialog, the System deletes the alarm from the system database, the System removes the alarm from the Alarm List for all users seeing it.

#UCP 000 - UC 007: Browse Hierarchy  
#A user browses a hierarchy in the hierarchy browser by expanding and collapsing logical nodes and selecting field objects of which the system displays the accessible properties in the work area.  
The Object Browser displays hierarchies (with parent logical nodes, children logical nodes and field objects for each logical node) that an authenticated User owns, All hierarchies are user specific and are persisted in the database, The User expands the first level of the hierarchy by selecting the “+” handle next to the hierarchy name, after the System displays the direct children of the expanded hierarchy and switches the “+” handle of the hierarchy name to a “-” handle, If a hierarchy is selected / highlighted by a user, then the system displays the hierarchy name and the hierarchy description in the Work Area. the User expands a logical node in the hierarchy by selecting the “+” handle next to the logical node name, If a logical node is selected / highlighted by a user, then the system displays the logical node name in the Work Area. The System displays the direct children of the expanded logical node and switches the “+” handle of the logical node to a “-” handle.  The User selects a field object from the children of the expanded node, after that the System verifies the access rights of the user to the properties of the selected field object, then the System displays the field object name and the field object properties to which the user has at least read access in the work area. The User collapses a logical node in the hierarchy by selecting the “-” handle next to the logical node name, ater that the System hides all children of the logical node and switches the “-” handle of the logical node name to an “+” handle. The User collapses a hierarchy by selecting the “-” handle next to the hierarchy name after the System hides all children of the hierarchy and switches the “-” handle of the hierarchy name to an “+” handle.
