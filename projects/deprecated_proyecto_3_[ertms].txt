ETCS shall provide the driver with information to allow him to drive the train safely. 
ETCS shall be able to supervise train and shunting movements.
If the supervision is performed by a RBC it shall be possible to prevent movements of a traction unit in its area if not authorised by the RBC
ETCS is required to be functional to a maximum train speed of 500 km/h.
The following definitions shall apply for the ETCS application levels: Level 0, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level STM (Specific Transmission Module).
It shall be possible to implement one or more of the ETCS application levels on a line.
Trains equipped for ERTMS/ETCS application level 3 shall be able to run on lines equipped with ERTMS/ETCS application level 3, 2, 1 and 0, trains equipped for ERTMS/ETCS application level 2 shall be able to run on lines equipped with ERTMS/ETCS application level 2, 1 and 0 and trains equipped for ERTMS/ETCS application level 1 shall be able to run on lines equipped with ERTMS/ETCS application level 1 and 0. 
The current application level shall be indicated on the DMI.
The driver shall acknowledge the level transitions, if requested from trackside. If the driver does not acknowledge after the transition the brake shall be applied. If the driver acknowledges afterwards, the brake can be released.
ETCS shall be compatible with existing national systems listed in the CCS TSI such that it does not interfere with the national systems and is not interfered with by the national systems.
