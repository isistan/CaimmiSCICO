@Requirement

# Introductory Movie
If the user clicks a mouse button while in the Introductory Movie component, they will skip the movie and proceed to the main menu. No other input is recognized.
Upon entrance to the movie component, the introductory movie will begin playing. If a mouse click is received, this component will terminate the movie and forward the user to the main menu component. Otherwise, the movie will continue to its completion and the user will be moved to the main menu.

# Main Menu
The user can click on the corresponding button to begin the game or follow the link to the Denominators' web page.
This component will wait until the user selects a button. At that time, the user will be forwarded to the game sequence component or the Denominators' web page, depending on the button selected. A movie is displayed on the screen.

# Game Sequence
The user will respond to questions by clicking on the desired answer from a set of choices.  
The Game Sequence  component will display a question, and then wait until the user chooses an answer.

If the user selects the correct answer, a message to this effect will be displayed and the component will move to the next question.
If the incorrect answer is selected, this component will inform the user of this and give them another chance to answer the question. However, their score will not count this question as being answered correctly.
At certain "critical points," this component will choose different directions in the plot based on whether the question at the critical point was answered correctly.
After the user has proceeded through a set number of questions, they will be directed to the ending scene component.

# Ending Scene
The user can select either to end the game or return to the main menu via  mouse clicks. 
This component will wait until the user selects either to return to the main menu or to exit the game. After receiving the user's input, the component will act accordingly.

#Question Updater
The user will input new data via pulldown menus and text fields. Each question will be updated on a separate page, and the user will click a button to progress between these pages.
The component will wait for the user to click a submission button for each question. After the button is clicked, the component will check that the inputted data is complete and makes sense in the context of the updated question.
The component will generate a text file on the game server, which is used by the game sequence to dynamically load question data.
